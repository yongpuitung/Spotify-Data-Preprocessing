# Spotify-Data-Preprocessing
In this project, I utilize R to preprocess Spotify's "Unpopular Songs" and "Genre of Artists" datasets from Kaggle. Following Hadley Wickham’s “Tidy Data” principles, I have cleaned up all types of messy data to ensure the resulting clean dataset is ready for statistical analysis, ensuring accurate and ethical data practices.

Check out the detailed data preprocessing in the code.

This project, derived from my personal RMIT Master of Analytics assignment in the "Data Wrangling" course (2022), has been modified and refined to showcase data preprocessing techniques using R.
