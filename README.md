# Spotify-Data-Preprocessing
This project utilizes R to preprocess Spotify's "Unpopular Songs" and "Genre of Artists" datasets from Kaggle. Following tidy data principles, it handles duplicates, transforms variables, scans for outliers, and normalizes data. The resulting clean dataset is ready for statistical analysis, ensuring accurate and ethical data practices.
